	<h6>
		Squad Rules for ALL Servers.
	</h6>
	<hr>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Do not make a Squad if you do not intend to lead the squad, even if there are no available squads to join.
			Wait until a squad is created.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			No intentional teamkilling, of any manner.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Squad Leader must have a microphone and must communicate in Command and Squad voice chat.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Vehicles that require the crewman role must leave main with a driver and a gunner, preferably in the same
			squad, but not limited to.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Armor, Helicopters, and Transport/Logistic vehicles must be claimed by naming the squad as the vehicle type.
			For example, if a player wanted to fly the helicopter for his team, he would name his squad HELI.
			<ol>
				<li>
					Squads created first with the proper name have priority to the vehicle. For example, Squad 1 named
					Recon must give up the helicopter to Squad 3 named HELI, even though they created the squad, and got
					to the helicopter first.
				</li>
				<li>
					Squads created with the proper name must follow the squad number given to them by the game. For
					example, if there are two helicopter squads, and one is Squad 3 HELI and the other is Squad 2 HELI,
					Squad 2 has priority, and Squad 3 must give up the helicopter.

				</li>
				<li>
					The exception to this rule is if a squad gives up their vehicle and allows another squad to take the
					vehicle. The squad who gives up the vehicle must wait until the vehicle respawns or until another
					vehicle spawns.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Locked squads must have a minimum of 4 players to be locked.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Main camping is not allowed. Main camping is defined by: Any player who has the intention of ambushing
			troops as they leave Main base, and is within 400m from their main on large scale maps, and 250m from their
			main on small scale maps.
			<ol>
				<li>
					Mines, explosives, or IEDs must be at least 400m from the opposing teams' main on large-scale maps,
					and 250m from the main on small-scale maps.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Do not use any type of external assistance, cheats, hacks, or exploits. This includes glitching through
			walls and/or objects.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Do not stream snipe. This will result in an immediate and permanent ban.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			We do not permit nor condone sexist, racist, or homophobic comments in our Squad or Discord server(s). Any
			comments that fall into this category will be removed as soon as possible, and the aggressor will be dealt
			with.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Do not be toxic in any kind of manner. This includes antagonizing other players into an argument, annoying a
			specific individual and/or multiple people with the intent to annoy, and do not provoke anyone
			intentionally.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Do not spam, troll, or grieve your own team. This includes but is not limited to digging down friendly FOBs,
			stealing vehicles from other squads, wasting vehicles, or removing supplies from a vehicle to sabotage the
			team.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Do not advertise your own or anyone's social media channels. This includes but is not limited to YouTube,
			Twitch, Instagram, and Twitter.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Do not intentionally ram into another helicopter, into a friendly vehicle, into the ground, off a bridge, or
			into the water. This falls under griefing and trolling.
		</li>
		<hr>
		<li>
			Be respectful to all individuals both in our Squad and Discord server(s).
		</li>
